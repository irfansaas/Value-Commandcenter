## 🏗️ Architecture (Very Simple)

```
You make deal data
         ↓
lib/deals.ts (store it here)
         ↓
lib/types.ts (make sure it matches types)
         ↓
components/ (React shows it beautifully)
         ↓
app/page.tsx (orchestrates everything)
         ↓
Browser (user sees dashboard)
```

No databases. No APIs. All client-side. Simple & fast.

---

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Can I add my own deals?**  
A: Yes! Edit `lib/deals.ts` and add objects to the array. TypeScript will verify everything.

**Q: How many deals can this handle?**  
A: Easily 1,000+. Your 50 deals is no problem.

**Q: Is it really type-safe?**  
A: Yes. 100% TypeScript coverage. Cursor will catch errors before they happen.

**Q: How do I deploy?**  
A: Push to GitHub → Vercel auto-deploys. See DEVELOPMENT.md Phase 4.

**Q: Can I add authentication?**  
A: Yes, later (Phase 2). For now, internal only.

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

**Port 3000 in use?**

lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
npm run dev
```

**npm install fails?**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

**TypeScript errors?**
```bash
npm run type-check
# Fix errors, Cursor will help
```

**Deployment fails?**
